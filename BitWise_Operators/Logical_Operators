Logical Operators
 * The Logical operators perform operations using AND , OR , and NOT gate;
 * These operators are used to combine two or more conditions or complement the evaluation of the original condition under particular condition;
 * While using AND operator if the first condition is false the short circuiting happens i.e the second condition is not considered;
 * Both AND and OR operators have short circuting effect;

Advantages
 * Readability
 * Flexibility
 * Reusability
 * Debugging
Disadvantages
 * Short circuit evaluation (ex: (a>b)&&(b++>c) if first condition is false the second condition is not evaluated , so our increment operator fails)
 * Limited Expressiveness(ex: if else,switch,etc.. can handle multiple condition where as logical operators cant handle it)
 * Potential for Confusion(ex: when it comes to complex expressivness it confuses (a and b or c) when () are used it can be identified)
 * Boolean coercion
